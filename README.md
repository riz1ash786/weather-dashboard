# Weather Dashboard

## Description

- I have been tasked to create a weather dashboard to display the weather outlook for multiple cities and offer the current weather conditions as well as the weather forecast for the subsequent 5 days.

## Acceptance Criteria - Checklist

- The user is able to input a city of their choice into the input field and click the search button to bring up the current and future weather condiions for that city.

- The user at this stage is able to see the name of the chosen city, the date, an icon reprsenting the weather conditons, the tempersture, the humidity, the wind speed and the UV index.

- The levels of UV are categorised over 5 levels. Depdndent on the level of UV within that chosen city, the UV index number is displayed on a colour according to its severity.

- The 5 day forcast also displays to the user the date, an icon to represent the current weather conditions, temperature and levels of humidity.

- The suer is also able to view a list of the searches that they have made on the deployed site and if they wish they are able to click on a city in the seach history to prersent them once again with the current and future weather conditions.
